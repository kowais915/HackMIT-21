            <p id="intro">This app is aimed towards a cleaner environment. Since littering is a major problem in Pakistan so I thought there's should be a fun app that locates the nearest bins and encourages people to avoid littering. The app locates trashbins on campus. Some of the features are not working atm and I am working on more functionalities inlcuding authantication and marking off areas that needs to be cleaned. I will be adding interactivity so user can interact with different elements on the map. The area shown on the map is my school - Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences & Technology. </p>
